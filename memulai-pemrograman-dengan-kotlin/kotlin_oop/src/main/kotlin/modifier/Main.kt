package modifier

fun main() {
    /**
     * Here are the kinds of access rights and a brief explanation that can be used in Kotlin:
     *
     * Public: The access right with the broadest scope. Members with this modifier can be accessed from anywhere.
     *
     * Private: The access right with the most limited scope. Members to which it applies can only be accessed within the same scope. Usually in the same file
     *
     * Protected: Access rights whose scope is limited to the class hierarchy. Members can only be accessed on their child classes or the class itself.
     *
     * Internal: An access right whose scope is limited to a single module. Members who use it cannot be accessed outside of that module. Usually in the same folder
